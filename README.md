## App description
### Data Exploration page
This page is for exploration of the Climate data and Shape file of Nepal wth district boundary. This page includes 3 Tabs:
- Overview
**Overview** tab gives overview of the dataset along with climate data visualization
- Map
**Map** tab shows map of nepal with district boundaries. It also visualize choropleth maps for selected climate variable with checkbox.
- Trends
**Trends** tab shows time-series plot and monthwise boxplot for selected climate variable and selected district.

### EDA with climate events Page
This page shows some EDA with the added climate events and Extreme-Event in the given raw dataset

### Feature Engineering Page
This page perform Feature Engineering. Click "Apply Feature Engineering" button for applying the feature engineering in the dataset.

### Model Training and Evaluation Page
This page is for Model training and evaluation of the models. Select test data size from slider and click "Train All Model" button to train 3 models in sequence:
- Regression model
- Multi class classification model
- Binary classification model
Purpose of each model is described in the page. After training model is evaluated and its result is displayed in the table

### Prediction Page
This is prediction page. Choose the date and district for prediction as required. Prediction also uses three models in sequence.
- **Regression model** predict day-by-day climate data for a district up to target_date.
- **Multi class classification model** predicts climate envet type and their corresponding probability based on output of Regression model and feature engineered features.
- **Binary classification model** predicts extreme event and its probability based on output of Regression model and feature engineered features.
